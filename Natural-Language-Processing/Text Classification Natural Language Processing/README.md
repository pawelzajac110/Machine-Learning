Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This folder contains foundational NLP projects, including data preprocessing, text classification, and sentiment analysis. The included dataset and Jupyter Notebook demonstrate various techniques in processing and analyzing textual data.

Key Files:
1. Natural Language Processing.ipynb
  A Jupyter Notebook showcasing several NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building for classification tasks.

2. smsspamcollection/SMSSpamCollection.txt
  A dataset containing a collection of SMS messages categorized as spam or ham (non-spam). Used for text classification and spam detection.

Projects and Techniques:
  Text Classification: Training a model to classify text messages into categories (spam/ham).
  Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and vectorization of text data for machine learning tasks.
  Modeling: Using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or LSTM for text classification.
