Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This folder contains key projects and models for natural language processing (NLP), including foundational techniques and algorithms used to process and analyze human language. These projects serve as the basis for understanding and applying NLP in various domains such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and named entity recognition.

Projects:
1. Text Classification
  A project demonstrating text classification, where we categorize text into predefined labels (e.g., spam vs. ham, sentiment analysis).

2. Sentiment Analysis
  A basic model for sentiment analysis, capable of determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  A project to identify and classify named entities (such as people, locations, and organizations) in a text.

4. Machine Translation
  An introductory example of a machine translation model, translating text from one language to another using seq2seq or transformer-based models.

5. Text Generation
  A simple model for text generation, such as using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or GPT-like models, to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

6. Word Embeddings
  Projects focusing on generating vector representations for words using techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.
